# Provenance: paper versions, artifact versions, and how they line up

Two objects evolve on separate clocks: the **paper** on arXiv and the **formal
development** on Zenodo. This file records both, including the historical period
when the paper and the newest artifact version differed.

## Paper versions

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | 2026-05-29 | first posting |
| v2 | 2026-06-12 | 31 pages, 5 figures; cites formal artifact 2.0 |
| v3 | 2026-08-08 | 31 pages, 5 figures; updates the cited and ancillary formal artifact to 2.1, adopts the `Machine-checked` status label, and adds practitioner clarifications |
| v4 | 2026-08-13 | 29 pages, 5 figures; readability revision with rewritten abstract, introduction, headings, and captions |
| **v5** | **2026-09-09** | **current version**; 28 pages, 5 figures; wording revision in every section, with a rewritten abstract and conclusion. Cites and carries formal artifact 2.1, unchanged. The manuscript files in `paper/` are this version. |

## Artifact versions

| Version | DOI | Date | Theories | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | [10.5281/zenodo.20389697](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20389697) | 2026-05-26 | 17 | first deposit; witnesses and counterexample fixtures were introduced by `axiomatization` |
| 2.0 | [10.5281/zenodo.20652511](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20652511) | 2026-06-12 | 37 | foundations rebuilt conservatively and **axiom-free** — every witness and fixture is now a constructed instance. **The nine headline theorem statements unchanged.** |
| **2.1** | [10.5281/zenodo.21732790](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21732790) | 2026-08-01 | 38 | fixture repair (below). **The nine headline theorem statements unchanged**; the repaired control's own statement is strictly strengthened. |

Each version is also a tag in this repository: [`v1.0`](../../../tree/v1.0),
[`v2.0`](../../../tree/v2.0), [`v2.1`](../../../tree/v2.1). The tags preserve
the layout each version was published with; the corpus moved under `formal/`
only when this repository became the paper's information hub.

## The 2.0 / 2.1 history

ArXiv v2 cites artifact version 2.0 (`10.5281/zenodo.20652511`), which was the
current deposit when v2 was posted on 2026-06-12. Artifact 2.1 was published on
2026-08-01. ArXiv v3, v4 and v5 cite version 2.1, and all three carry
`DBLog_Virtual_Cuts-2.1` as an ancillary directory. The `formal/` tree in this
repository is byte-identical to that v5 ancillary and to the version 2.1 Zenodo
deposit.

An external review of the 2.0 artifact found that one negative control in the
Layer 3 fixtures was **vacuous**: the same-evidence control failed to
materialize its run, so the accessor-agreement comparison it advertised was
never actually reached. The control passed for the wrong reason. No theorem
statement was affected, and no proof depended on it.

Version 2.1 makes two changes to the theories:

1. the control in `Layer3_Fixtures_Inst.thy` now materializes its run, so the
   comparison it advertises is genuinely exercised;
2. a new kernel-checked theory `Layer3_Defect_Regressions.thy` pins that
   reachability permanently, so the defect cannot silently return.

Four other files change with them: `ROOT` registers the new theory, `README.md`
counts and lists it and carries the 2.1 release identification, and
`document/root.tex` and `document/root.bib` name version 2.1. No other file
differs between the 2.0 and 2.1 archives.

The nine headline theorem statements are identical across 2.0 and 2.1. Readers
of arXiv v2 should expect the repaired fixture and regression theory when they
compare its cited artifact with this repository. Readers of arXiv v3, v4 or v5
see the same 2.1 corpus in the paper ancillary, Zenodo deposit, and `formal/`
tree.

## Which identifier to cite

- **Concept DOI** `10.5281/zenodo.20389696` — when you mean "the formal
  development" and want the reader to land on the newest version.
- **Version DOI** — when the bytes matter: a build log, a review, a
  reproduction, a claim about a specific theory file.
- **This repository** — for reading and browsing. The Zenodo deposit remains
  the archival identifier; the repository is a convenience mirror plus context.

## Checking the mirror

```bash
curl -sL https://zenodo.org/records/21732790/files/DBLog_Virtual_Cuts-2.1.tar.gz | tar xz
diff -r DBLog_Virtual_Cuts-2.1 formal    # no output means identical
```

## Verification environment

Both 2.0 and 2.1 are checked with **Isabelle2025-2**
(`ISABELLE_IDENTIFIER=Isabelle2025-2`), using `HOL-Library` from the
distribution only — no Archive of Formal Proofs entry is required. The session
builds `sorry`-free and generates its own entry document, which needs a LaTeX
toolchain.
