Sources for the paper **“A Theoretical Study of DBLog: Certified Virtual Cuts
for a Snapshot-Equivalent Replay of Live Databases”** (Andreas Andreakis, 2026)
and the machine-checked Isabelle/HOL development that accompanies it.

The paper formalizes the backfill mechanism of DBLog, a change-data-capture
framework. It defines the *certified virtual cut*: a finite bundle of log events
and chunk reads whose replay reaches the source state at a chosen log position,
for the keys being copied. It proves nine main theorems about it in
Isabelle/HOL, without `sorry` and without axioms. Each theorem holds under the
assumptions stated in it. The deployment obligations and the faithfulness of
the source observation are assumptions. The proofs do not establish them. The work
verifies a model of the mechanism. It does not verify any implementation.

## The paper

- **arXiv v5:** [abs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.31475v5) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.31475v5). 28 pages, 5 figures, cs.DB + cs.LO, CC BY 4.0.
- **In this repository:** [`paper/dblog_virtual_cuts_v5.pdf`](paper/dblog_virtual_cuts_v5.pdf), arXiv's own build of v5 with its margin stamp.
- **Build it yourself.** The figures are TikZ sources under `paper/figures/`, so no external image files are needed:

  ```bash
  cd paper && pdflatex main && bibtex main && pdflatex main && pdflatex main
  ```

## The proofs

Requires [Isabelle2025-2](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/). The session depends only
on `HOL-Library` from the distribution. It needs no Archive of Formal Proofs
entry.

```bash
isabelle build -d formal DBLog_Virtual_Cuts
```

All 38 theories check `sorry`-free, and the session builds its own PDF
document, which requires a LaTeX toolchain. To check proofs without LaTeX,
remove the `document = pdf, document_output = "output"` options from
`formal/ROOT` first, because session options take precedence over
`-o document=false` on the command line.

Nothing is axiomatized: there is no `axiomatization`, `typedecl` or `consts`
declaration, and the single `typedef` (the source coordinate type) is a
conservative extension over a provably non-empty set.

To check this tree against the archived deposit:

```bash
curl -sL https://zenodo.org/records/21732790/files/DBLog_Virtual_Cuts-2.1.tar.gz | tar xz
diff -r DBLog_Virtual_Cuts-2.1 formal   # no output means identical
```

ArXiv v5 cites formal artifact 2.1 and carries `DBLog_Virtual_Cuts-2.1` as an
ancillary directory. That ancillary, the Zenodo 2.1 deposit, and this
repository's `formal/` tree are byte-identical. The concept DOI always resolves
to the newest version. A version DOI names exact bytes. Cite the version DOI
when you need the exact bytes. Full history:
